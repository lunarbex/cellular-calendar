# Cellular Calendar + Gestural Interface

A durational calendar designed as living cells with membranes, intentions, and intercellular communication — navigated through deliberate physical gesture via finger-worn capacitive tap sensors.

## Concept

Time is not a linear grid—it's a living system. This project holds two intertwined threads:

**The Calendar** — temporal periods as biological **cells**:
- **Membranes** - boundaries that define the period's container
- **Intentions** - the purpose or meaning held within each timespan
- **Timespan** - variable duration (days, weeks, months, years)
- **Fodder** - resources, notes, materials accumulated within the period
- **Extra-cellular matrix** - connections between cells where information flows

**The Gesture Layer** — finger-worn capacitive sensors for deliberate, embodied interaction:
- Tap gestures as the physical interface for moving through temporal space
- State tracking through touch rather than passive monitoring
- The body as navigator of the information environment
- Deliberate engagement over ambient surveillance

Rather than forcing life into rigid boxes, or interaction into a keyboard and mouse, this approach lets you spatially arrange temporal periods and physically move through them.

## Philosophy

This tool emerges from a practice of creating **coherent information environments**—spaces that facilitate transformation through spatial design, systems thinking, and somatic awareness.

Traditional calendars impose their structure on you. Traditional interfaces extract interaction from the body. This project asks: *What if your temporal landscape could breathe, and your body could move through it?*

## Current State

- ✓ Cellular calendar running in browser
- ✓ Cell membranes, intentions, fodder, matrix connections
- ⚙ Tap sensor hardware in fabrication
- ◯ Gesture-to-cell interaction layer (forthcoming)
- ◯ 3D spatial navigation (forthcoming)

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your browser. No server or installation required.

**Basic Interactions:**
- **New Cell** - creates a temporal container
- **Drag cells** - spatially arrange your time
- **Click cell** - edit intention, timespan, fodder, appearance
- **Connect mode** - create matrix fibers between related cells
- **Watch** - communication particles flow along connections

**Design Principles:**
- Organic over orthogonal
- Spatial relationships over sequential lists
- Deliberate physicality over passive monitoring
- Demonstration as documentation

## Development

This is a living practice, not a finished product. Hardware and software developing in parallel, informing each other.

Developed in collaboration with Claude as part of ongoing research into gestural interfaces, durational mapping, and coherent information environments.
