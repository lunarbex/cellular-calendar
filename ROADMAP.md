# Development Roadmap

This is a living document—not a rigid plan. Ideas emerge and evolve.

## Current State

✓ Cell creation with membranes  
✓ Spatial arrangement through drag  
✓ Intention, timespan, fodder tracking  
✓ Extra-cellular matrix connections  
✓ Visual communication particles  
✓ Timespan units (days/weeks/months/years)  

## Threads

### Gesture Layer (Active)
- Finger-worn capacitive sensors in fabrication
- Tap pattern → state machine → calendar action
- Gesture vocabulary evolving through hardware testing
- JavaScript bridge connecting sensor events to calendar
- See GESTURE_LAYER.md for full documentation

### 3D Navigation
- Z-axis for temporal depth
- Camera controls for navigating the space
- Cells existing in volumetric relationships
- Gesture navigation through 3D space (pinch, rotate, push)

### Semantic Clustering
- Cells with related intentions gravitate toward each other
- Automatic organization based on fodder similarity
- Force-directed layouts that evolve over time

### Biological Behaviors
- Cells that "grow" as they accumulate fodder
- Cell division when timespans complete
- Membrane permeability that changes based on connection strength
- Metabolic visualization (energy flows between cells)

### Persistence & Memory
- Save/load cellular landscapes
- Export as JSON for sharing configurations
- Import external data sources as cells

### Temporal Physics
- Cells earlier in time could "pull" on future cells
- Completed cells could fade or crystalize
- Current moment highlighted as "living edge"

### Community Features
- Share cellular landscapes
- Fork/remix others' temporal structures
- Gallery of approaches to durational mapping

### Documentation
- Video demonstrations of gesture + calendar interaction
- Example landscapes for different contexts (project planning, healing timelines, learning arcs)
- Integration with other PIM practices

## Philosophy

Development follows need and curiosity, not completeness. Some branches will grow, others will remain potential. The tool should stay light enough to evolve.

## Questions to Explore

- When does spatial arrangement become constraining rather than liberating?
- What's the relationship between visual metaphor and felt experience?
- How do we balance structure and emergence?
- What would it mean for the calendar to "learn" from how you use it?
